# Tana2D verification

This record covers the separate Tana2D fork. Historical Tana evidence is retained
in [TANA-VERIFICATION.md](TANA-VERIFICATION.md).

## Checked on October 13, 2026

- `make all test` passed: 15 native test executables and 20 Python tests. The build
  retains seven warnings for unused legacy strip functions.
- Gesture tests cover 24 directions at two zoom levels, stable finger identities,
  changed contact order, finger lifts/replacements, stale frames, and independent
  devices. Screen movement follows the sensor's right/up coordinates, with the
  vertical sign converted to screen coordinates. Dock's one-axis progress no
  longer drives the camera. Raw touches stay in memory and are not logged.
- Native tests cover real initial dimensions, independent resize, zoomed edge hit
  testing, magnetic adjacency, position notifications without unnecessary resize,
  repeated absolute transforms against the helper's toggle protocol, and reset.
- Signed packaging, deep/strict signature verification, and installation at
  `/Applications/Tana2D.app` passed. The original Tana executable remains unchanged.
- Native camera controls were rendered and visually inspected; Fit all and 100%
  were also exercised against the running manager.
- Live WindowServer checks passed for signed world positions, camera movement in
  all four quadrants, inverse screen translation, zoom in/out, movement/undo,
  fit-all without rearrangement, repeated fit, and native-transform reset.
- External `borders` surfaces were observed at zero alpha while Tana2D owns the
  desktop. Tana2D draws one focused outline and restores external alpha on quit.

## Live state and remaining acceptance

Tana2D is installed and active on the target Mac. The manager reports a ready
backend, an enabled input tap, and zero movement failures. Raw multitouch device
registration succeeds. Physical diagonal/circular swipes and magnetic title-bar
or Option drags still require user acceptance; registration and mathematical
checks alone do not prove physical gesture feel. Native dragging now suppresses
further AppKit drag events after the plane owns the drag; mouse-up still reaches
AppKit to end the interaction.

`make live-tools` builds disposable fixture windows and measurement probes.
`python3 tests/live_plane_check.py` checks live native geometry without generating
input. It restores camera/focus and closes only its disposable fixture windows.
The optional generated-input probes do not establish physical trackpad behavior.
Older `live_*` harnesses were inherited from Tana and may assert strip behavior.

No login/reboot, VoiceOver, other-hardware, or other-macOS-version acceptance is
claimed. The MultitouchSupport bridge uses a private macOS interface.

## Project isolation

Repository: `elliott-leow/Tana2D`. Bundle identity, executable, configuration/layout
directory, IPC sockets, privileged helper, and scripting addition paths are
separate from Tana. The shared manager lock prevents simultaneous management.
Tana/HorizontalWM state is not imported. Layout version 3 ignores invalid size
caches from version 2 and recovers actual native dimensions.
